# Earthquake-Data-Visualization

Data visualization is the graphical representation of data and information, designed to communicate complex data in a clear and concise way for better understanding and decision-making.
It is difficult to find meaning in large volumes of “textual” output, most users
prefer pictures: graphs, pie charts, and other graphical representations.
